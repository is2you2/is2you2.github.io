# Project Cone (pjcone_pwa) – Full UX/UI and Feature Review (English)

## 1. User Experience

Project Cone provides a minimalist, offline-first communication environment with anonymous access. While it offers strong performance for habitual users, initial use may feel unfamiliar due to unique terms like “quest” and “channel.” UX design prioritizes autonomy, offering sync-free local functionality with server synchronization upon reconnection.

## 2. UI Layout Suitability

The interface is compact and dark-themed, optimized for keyboard navigation. Functional elements like quests, chats, and personal notes are efficiently grouped, but advanced tools (e.g., drawing) may appear cryptic to new users. Visual hierarchy is consistent and highly responsive on desktop and mobile.

## 3. Functional Adequacy

Its features align well with its goal as a project-oriented team messenger. Support for image/audio/video/3D files and annotation features makes it suitable for creative teams. Channel-based communication, file comments, and self-messaging support both collaboration and personal workflow management.

## 4. Accessibility

Keyboard navigation is excellent. Language support includes Korean and English. However, the app lacks accessibility standards like screen reader support or high contrast modes, which limits usability for visually or physically impaired users.

## 5. Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**  
- Offline-first architecture  
- Anonymous, registration-free access  
- Visual quest-based task tracking  
- In-file commenting for collaborative feedback  
- Keyboard-driven navigation  

**Weaknesses**  
- Requires own server setup  
- Steep learning curve for new users  
- Limited accessibility support  
- Lacks voice/video calls, push notifications  
- No support/community ecosystem

## 6. Potential Improvements

- Add mobile notifications, live collaboration, and advanced search  
- Offer guided onboarding and documentation  
- Provide official server packages (e.g., Docker)  
- Support third-party tool integrations  
- Enhance accessibility (screen reader support, font scaling)

## 7. Critiques

- Cache-based storage risks accidental data loss  
- No user authentication → device-level privacy risks  
- Possible issues with browser compatibility  
- Performance may degrade in large-team usage  
- No support forum or official user channel

## Summary

Project Cone is an innovative, offline-first team tool with strong autonomy, anonymous access, and rich file annotation. It’s well-suited for creative teams but requires technical maturity. With improved accessibility, onboarding, and mobile usability, it could become a standout alternative in collaborative software.
